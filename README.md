# TwitterMultiToolBot

Bot defined with some usefull functions, is needed to create config.js in root directory with app and user consumer and access tokens, I leave an example at the end of this doc. Also is required to uncoment functions and create your own program. In case of wanting to upload to a server, use the comand "setInterval(*functionName*, *milisecons*);" to leave it running in a loop.

## Config.js file example

module.exports = {

    consumer_key: '',
  
    consumer_secret: '',
  
    access_token: '',  
  
    access_token_secret: ''
  
}
